# Melody Makers
## Collaborators: Yasser Hernandez, Anish Ramanadham

Melody Maker is a simulated mini music streaming service with 1 million subscribers and a daily average of 10 thousand users. It is a database-driven website that is designed to help users search, create, and share music playlists, and make it easier for them to discover new music. The Music Playlist Database itself helps Melody Maker store, manage, update, and keep track of these playlists as well as the length, release date, and artists for specific songs. Ultimately, this new system will help improve the data management efficiency of Melody Maker and its growing user base.
